    <h2>My mom's special homemade lasagna recipe </h2>

    <p> This is my mom's special lasagma recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato 
        sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be 
        made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and 
        Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic
        bread.
